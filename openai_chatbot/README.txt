This is my simple test for OpenAI api calling

The chatbot is a simply program like chatgpt

The mark1.py is used to respond to the command that is in the code itself

The mark2.py is used to repsond to user input commands and also remember the previous discussion with the user

The mark3.py is a classic sassy chatbot that you can share with your friends.

To use the project you need your own openai api key, and also python, openai, gradio install in your IDE.
